        <h1>COFFEE CANTATA</h1>

        <p>
          The catch phrase for Coffee Cantata, “Coffee: Music in a Cup,”
          captures creator Margaret’s unpretentious approach to coffee
          connoisseurship. Her coffee reviews are cross-referenced by geographic
          origin and brew method. The precise details of the extraction process,
          like temperature and coffee-to-water ratio, are meticulously recorded
          so you can repeat the experience at home. Her tasting notes are vivid
          and delightful and they include serving thoughts, such as how the brew
          pairs with milk
